# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Android Development Task

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents Task 3 of the internship, which focuses on building a basic stopwatch app for Android.

## Task Overview

The objective of this task is to develop a stopwatch app for Android that allows users to:
- **Display** minutes, seconds, and milliseconds
- **Start**, **pause**, and **reset** the timer

## Steps

1. **Setup Project**:
   - Create a new Android project in Android Studio.
   - Configure project settings including project name, package name, and target SDK.

2. **Design UI**:
   - Implement the user interface for the stopwatch using XML.
   - Include a `TextView` to display the time, and `Button`s to start, pause, and reset the stopwatch.
   - Arrange these UI components in a `RelativeLayout` or `ConstraintLayout` for organized positioning.

3. **Implement Logic**:
   - Write Java code in `MainActivity.java` to handle the stopwatch functionalities.
   - Implement logic to manage the timer, including starting, pausing, and resetting.
   - Use a `Handler` to update the `TextView` with the elapsed time and manage timer updates.

4. **Write Tests**:
   - Develop instrumented tests to verify the app’s functionality and correctness.
   - Create test cases to validate the stopwatch's start, pause, and reset functionalities.
   - Use Espresso for UI testing to ensure that the app behaves as expected under various scenarios.

5. **Build & Run**:
   - Compile the app using Android Studio and resolve any build issues.
   - Test the app on an Android device or emulator to ensure it operates as expected.
   - Verify that all functionalities work correctly and that the app handles user input gracefully.

## Knowledge Gained

- **Android Application Development**:
  - Gained practical experience in setting up and managing an Android app project.
  - Learned how to use Android Studio for development and debugging.

- **User Interface (UI) Design**:
  - Acquired skills in designing intuitive and functional user interfaces for mobile applications.
  - Implemented layouts using XML to create a clear and user-friendly stopwatch interface.

- **Handling Timer Logic**:
  - Developed logic to manage a stopwatch, including handling timing operations and user interactions.
  - Implemented functionality to ensure accurate timing and user control.

- **Testing in Android**:
  - Developed skills in creating and executing instrumented tests using Espresso.
  - Ensured the app’s reliability and functionality through rigorous testing.

## Summary

This task involved the development of a basic stopwatch app for Android, covering the following aspects:
- **Project Setup**: Configured and initialized an Android project.
- **UI Design**: Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for the stopwatch using XML.
- **Logic Implementation**: Developed the core logic to handle timing operations and manage user interactions.
- **Testing**: Created and ran instrumented tests to validate the app’s functionality and correctness.

The provided instrumented tests confirm that the app’s context is correctly configured and that core functionalities are operational.

## Conclusion

The task successfully demonstrated the fundamental steps required to build a basic stopwatch app for Android, including:
- Effective design and implementation of the user interface.
- Development of core timing functionalities.
- Application of testing practices to ensure app reliability.
